Styling can also be done by creating a seperate folder for each component 
and saving a css file only for it there.
And for this we write import styles from that css file. This is written in the jsx file

For inline styling in jsx file:
    the properties must be written in camelcase
    the values must be a string
    the properties must be comma seperated

Props - Read only properties that are shared between components.
        A parent component can send data to a child component. 
propTypes - A mechanism that ensures that the passed value is of the correct datatype
For eg-  age: propTypes.number 
defaultProps- Default values for props incase they are not passed from the parent component
For eg- name: "Guest"

Conditional Rendering - Allows you to control what gets rendered in your application based on certain conditions
(show, hide or change components)
